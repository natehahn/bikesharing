# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to present share holders a clear proposal for a bike sharing program in Des Moines.  One of the stakeholders requested this analysis be done.  Below are the results of this analysis and depending on further analysis of demographics in Des Moines, I feel that a bike-sharing program would be beneficial.

### Results

The following is a breakout of each of the visualizations that describe different variables related to total number of bikes rented, bike rentals by gender, days of the week bikes were rented and where the top rental sites were located.

This graph represents how long users checkout out a bike for.  Most riders peaked at 5 minutes of ride time.  Only a few renters reached an hour of having the bike checked out.

This graph represents a breakdown of users by their gender and how long they checked out a bike.  Males are represented by the orange line, females by the blue line, and the red line depicts 'unknown' gender.  Males overwhelmingly are the dominant gender in users.

At first glance this visualization looks like something from the 90's.  However, this is a simple heat map of when the most number of bikes were rented by each our of each day.  The darker the red, the more bikes that were rented.  As you can see from this image, 7am-8am and 5pm-6pm were primary rental times.

This visualization is similar to the last however it depicts rental times on each day of the week by gender.  Same as before, the darker color red equates to higher number of bikes rented.

This color chart provides useful data on the number of bikes rented by subscriber broken out by gender.  The darker the blue the more bikes that were rented during that weekday.  Male subscribers were the predominant renters.

This map is one of the best visualizations in the whole analysis.  It provides a visual depiction of where each bike was rented from, which allows the business to determine the best areas to provide bike-sharing capability.

This line graph shows the age of bike renters.  This product, suprisingly, is used by those in their late 30's more than any other age group.  But it does show that it is also popular among the mid 20's age group.

## Summary

Visualizations are a powerful tool.
